Hi! I'm Javhaan, and welcome to my GitHub website 😁. I'm from the beautiful island of Saint Lucia 🇱🇨. The photo above was taken at the Pigeon Island National Park.

I have a deep passion for both technology and languages, which have become defining aspects of my life. My love for languages is particularly evident in my proficiency in French, where I hold a certified B2 level 🥖, and my ongoing journey in mastering the intricacies of German, a language I am self-learning with great enthusiasm. Technology, on the other hand, is a realm that constantly fascinates me. I find joy in exploring new gadgets, whether it's the latest laptops 🧑🏾‍💻, cutting-edge smartphones 📱, or any tech innovation that promises to enhance people's lives. However, I am also mindful of the potential pitfalls of technology dependency 😮‍💨, especially in the realm of social media. I've made a conscious effort to reduce my time spent on platforms like Tiktok and instead, I'm actively working on regaining my focus on long-form content, recognizing the importance of a balanced relationship with technology 🧘🏾‍♂️.

I have worked on projects so far in languages like, Python <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python" height="15"> and JavaScript <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="Javascript" height="15">. I have grown to appreciate both languages while actively learning to enhance my skills as a developer.

Currently, I serve as the Operations Associate at Elizabeth Consulting International Inc., working closely with the Lead Research and Engineering Scientist, Dr. Cheikh Mbengue, to advance software development projects for the Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA). I also provide support to the Finance Manager, Mingee Lucien, in various accounting and finance tasks.

I love video games, particularly The Sims 4. I'm currently taking a mini break from playing The Sims 4 while I decide on the next direction for my in-game family. My passion for music spans across various genres, including classical, 90s R&B, hyperpop, and 2000s pop. Additionally, I'm an avid reader, with a deep love for murder mysteries. In my opinion, it's the best book genre. 🤭
